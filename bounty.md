## Bounty

Create an autonomous AI agent that takes users desires and implements them on chain. This AI agent will take instructions from the user (e.g. "go on quests and level up"), and then automatically take the actions that achieve this goal.

## Reward:

**$9000 for the top 3 submissions.**
$1000 for the first 3 completed submissions.

## Deadline

**February 6th, 2025**

## Summary:

**[Mandatory]**

*   **User Input:** Build out some sort of frontend for the user to submit instructions and manage the AI agent. For example:
    *   "Want to farm as many magic carrots as possible in the next 24 hours."
    *   "Use 50% of my budget to buy seeds, then farm them"
    *   "balance resource gathering with occasional PVP matches."

*   **AI Planning:** Use your AI plugin (Eliza or a similar framework) to parse the instructions and break them down into smaller tasks.
    *   e.g., check in-game inventory, read market prices, farm carrots

*   **Autonomous Execution:** The AI triggers the required smart contract functions or game APIs via a Web3 provider or game-specific actions.
    *   (e.g., `harvestCarrots()`, `stakeTokens()`)
    *   It monitors ongoing actions, and adjusts strategy if needed.
    *   (e.g., if carrots are no longer profitable)

*   **Feedback to user:** The AI agent updates the user on progress or completion.

**[Mandatory]**

1. **Create or integrate a secure wallet integration system that:**
    *   Manages private keys securely
    *   Connects to Avalanche network and or Avalanche L1
    *   Handles transaction signing and execution
    *   Performs gas estimation and balance checks
    *   Maintains transaction history

**[Mandatory]**

1. **Productize it so anyone on Avalanche can try it or developers can build on or integrate with it.**

**[Optional]**

1. Monetize your AI gaming agent.
2. Fair launch a token associated with your project.
3. Integrate with questing platforms like Gaixe if applicable for the game

## Judging Criteria:

*   Quality of code with comments and unit testing.
*   Quality of documentation in the Readme.md
*   Creativity in execution.

## Resources:

*   [Avalanche Documentation](https://docs.avax.network/)
*   [Eliza framework](https://example.com)
*   [AI Agent dev school](https://example.com)

## Recommended experience:

*   Experience building LLM-powered applications and utilizing LLM APIs (Eliza, OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, etc.)
*   Understanding of prompt engineering and LLM interaction patterns
*   Experience with wallet integration, and interacting with smart contracts
*   Good experience in building autonomous bots

## Deliverables:

*   A working agent where the team can view the decisions and general thought process from the agent.
*   Test history with the AI Agent executing swaps/transfers from your wallet.
*   A GitHub Repo with proper documentation and a fleshed-out Readme.md that will be published as a polished instructions guide on the Academy for everyone to read.
*   A working video demo of your project

**Extra credit:**

*   Social media posts documenting your dev work.
*   Implementing the optional features or other ideas you have.

## What to submit:

*   Github link to the project
*   The link to your submitted Readme.md guide in [Avalanche Academy](https://academy.avax.network/)
*   A video walking through your project
