i think earnings should grow in proportion to the next cut fees, so they should be the same percentage amount every position. I dont know maybe its already the same. can you add a debugging tab where you mention all these rates and percentages? And in the real game, there is also usually faster progress, because there is a mechanism by which the first player in line has to wait a certain time period (say 3 minutes) then if he can maintain his first position, he can recover his position and the time wont reset back to 3 mins if someone cuts him. he will get into the reward zone, and free up his spot so everyone else will move up the line one position. When his reward period is over he will spawn back to the end of the line starting again.
